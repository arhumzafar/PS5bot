# PS5bot

## Revised in August 2023
Added support to get the Spiderman PS5 from BestBuy.



### Arhum Zafar - November 2021
This is my first attempt at making a PS5 bot to purchase from Walmart.

<br>
I have written this in Python and used Selenium to interact with web pages. The script uses recursion to prevent the code from crashing as it is built to run faster than the webpage. 
<br>

No promise it will work everytime though -- I'll be sure to update this file with my success/failures on buying a PS5 with this bot.
If the site crashes, the code will simply stop. (*You'll be able to tell when this happens*.)
<br>
<br>
Currently, this bot was built to purchase the PS5 digital version.
To run the code, **be sure to enter your address and payment info into the appropriate fields in each .py file.**
